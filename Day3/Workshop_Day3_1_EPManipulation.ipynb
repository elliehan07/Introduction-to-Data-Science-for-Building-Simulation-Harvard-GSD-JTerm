    "As a result it takes full advantage of the rich data structure and idioms that are avaliable in python. You can programmatically navigate, search, and modify E+ idf files using eppy. The power of using a scripting language allows you to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make a large number of changes in an idf file with a few lines of eppy code.\n",
    "- Use conditions and filters when making changes to an idf file\n",
    "- Make changes to multiple idf files.\n",
    "- Read data from the output files of a E+ simulation run.\n",
    "- Based to the results of a E+ simulation run, generate the input file for the next simulation run.\n",
    "\n",
    "###So what does this matter? Here are some of the things you can do with eppy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Change construction for all north facing walls.\n",
    "- Change the glass type for all windows larger than 2 square meters.\n",
    "- Change the number of people in all the interior zones.\n",
    "- Change the lighting power in all south facing zones. \n",
    "- Change the efficiency and fan power of all rooftop units.\n",
    "- Find the energy use of all the models in a folder (or of models that were run after a certain date) \n",
    "- If a model is using more energy than expected, keep increasing the R-value of the roof until you get to the expected energy use."
